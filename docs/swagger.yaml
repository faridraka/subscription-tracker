  description: |
    A production-grade Subscription Management System API built to handle real users, real payments, and real business workflows.

    This API uses JWT-based authentication, follows scalable architecture principles, and integrates cleanly with modern frontend applications. It is designed to support subscription lifecycles, user operations, and secure automation features.

    Key Capabilities:
    - **Advanced Rate Limiting & Bot Protection** powered by Arcjet.
    - **MongoDB Data Modeling** using Mongoose for schemas, relations, and validations.
    - **JWT Authentication** for secure user onboarding and session handling.
    - **Subscription Management** including creation, updates, renewals, and expiration handling.
    - **Global Error Handling** with consistent response formatting.
    - **Logging Mechanisms** for debugging and app monitoring.
    - **Email Reminders & Workflows** utilizing Upstash for automated notifications.
    - Production-ready architecture emphasizing clean code, reusability, and maintainability.
